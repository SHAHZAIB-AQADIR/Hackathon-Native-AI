# Introduction to Robotics and AI: Overview and Learning Objectives

Welcome to the foundational module of the Robotics & AI Handbook! This section sets the stage for your journey into the fascinating world where machines perceive, think, and act. Here, we will define what robotics and artificial intelligence encompass, explore their historical evolution, and survey the myriad of applications transforming our world today.

## Module Objectives

Upon completing this module, you will be able to:

*   **Define** robotics and artificial intelligence, understanding their distinctions and interconnections.
*   **Trace** the historical development of both fields, identifying key milestones and influential figures.
*   **Identify** diverse real-world applications of robotics and AI across various industries.
*   **Understand** the prerequisites necessary to effectively engage with the more technical modules of this book.
*   **Navigate** the structure and features of this handbook to optimize your learning experience.

## Why Start Here?

This introductory module is crucial for building a strong conceptual framework. Before delving into complex programming with ROS 2, sophisticated simulations with Gazebo, or advanced platforms like NVIDIA Isaac, it is essential to grasp the fundamental 'why' and 'what' of these fields. This will not only provide context but also ignite your curiosity for the detailed technical explorations ahead.

## What to Expect

We will cover:

*   **Defining Robotics and AI:** What are they, and how do they relate?
*   **A Brief History:** From ancient automata to modern deep learning.
*   **Real-World Applications:** Robotics in manufacturing, healthcare, exploration, and AI in data analysis, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.
*   **Essential Skills and Setup:** A roadmap of the knowledge and tools you'll need.

Let's begin our exploration!
